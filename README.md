# Experiment

This game is an experiment to determine how effective audio cues are in guiding the player.
Half of the levels will be played with visuals only, while the other half will be played with audio only.
The results will help to evaluate the effectiveness of audio cues in both normal games and audio games for the blind.  

Note: This must be played with headphones.

# Research Papers

The project was inspired by the following research papers:

Adkins, A., Kohm, K., Zhang, R., & Gustafson, N. (2020). Lost in Spaze: An Audio Maze Game for the Visually Impaired. Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.

# Gameplay

Players must navigate through a 2D maze as fast as possible. The first half of the game will be played with visuals only, while the second half will be played with audio only. There are 3 tutorials and 6 timed levels. During the audio levels, the screen is black, and the player must navigate by using the following audio cues:  
- Up = High pitch noise in both headphones  
- Down = Low pitch noise in both headphones  
- Right = Mid pitch noise only in right headphone  
- Left = Mid pitch noise only in left headphone  

After completing the game, the player will see a scoreboard of their times, which are then posted to a Firebase database.
